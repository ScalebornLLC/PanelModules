# What's the goal of this compared to AMPTemplates?
These templates are actively used which means more active and frequent updates. You still should probably not use this repo though. None of these templates will be built for windows compatibility as we do not run any servers with that OS. Updates are also not tested on a separate branch before being pushed to master. This github is maintained for the purpose of Scaleworx, public use is not recommended.
